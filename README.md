This project is a single page web app developed to find a location in Google maps using Place Autocomplete API

Even though this looks like a multi-page app, since I have used react-router, it is simulating a multi-page application even though the entire React app is still a single page application.

This app is hosted at [here](https://main.d3a5opck8kix1p.amplifyapp.com/) using AWS Amplify.
